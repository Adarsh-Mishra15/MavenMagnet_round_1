"Amazed!-I've been using cheap men's body washes for a long time and they always seem to dry my skin out. Even when I've tried the so-called moisturizing ones, I end up with the same result... Dry and itchy skin. I thought I'd give the Method Men Body Wash a try, as it claims to not have any of the harsh chemicals as the cheaper body washes. I must say, I am completely sold on this stuff. First off, it smells amazing. A nice subtle scent that isn't overpowering like many of the other big name washes. Secondly it rinses cleanly and doesn't dry my skin out to the point of needing to slather my body in lotion after a shower. The price difference is well worth it.

"Nice product, smells good, docked a star for false claims to be natural-This is a good body wash product. It smells good and my wife often comments how much she likes it.

I would have given it five stars, but it really rankles me that the manufacturer is trying to pass this product off as ""naturally derived."" The number two ingredient after water is sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a surfactant and foaming agent that gives you that nice lathery feeling that tells you you're getting clean. Yes, it can be derived from coconut or palm oil rather than from petroleum, and I guess that's what the manufacturer means.

But it's still sodium lauryl sulfate, for Pete's sake. I'm no rampant environmentalist that is going to tell you SLS will give you cancer. The FDA has tested and approved it. But when folks look for natural ingredients, it's not usually SLS they are seeking. There are plenty of people who will tell SLS is very dangerous. Even mainstream folks recognize it can irritate sensitive skin.

Nice body wash. But don't tell me your SLS product is natural. Please. This is just betting on consumer ignorance.

"Odd concept but works fine - For a body wash, this product is fine and the scent is pleasing without lingering on the body. The concept of applying it from a foam canister is different and still seems weird but it works and actually lathers better than the gel formats that I have tried. I donâ€™t believe that this product would go as far as the gel types but I am not sure (this is advertised to last for 30 showers).

"Really great, strong fragrance, different than regular body washes-I was curious to try a more ""Premium"" body wash than what I typically bought at a store. I found this product and was intrigued so figured i'd give it a try. The thing I noticed most was how ""Thick"" the product is. A lot of body wash is very watery, this product really seems to have a lot to it. With that more concentrated product, comes a really nice cedar/cypress scent and a sense that the product is really coating/cleaning wherever applied. Highly recommend giving it a try, it's definitely a different experience than a typical body wash.

"What's that smell honey?-That's usually the line my wife utters when I drop an absolute wet hammer on my old white best friend. This time, however, it's different. I would add a photo of what I look like after I take a shower but I'm trying NOT to impregnate the Eastern Seaboard. If you want to revitalize your marriage, increase your sex drive beyond definition and become the man your dad always says you're not then this product isn't for you.
